# Image Classification for a City Dog Show
This project is part of the AWS ML & AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Scholarship Program. The goal of this project is to use a pre-trained image classifier to identify different dog breeds.

# Project Goal
The main objective of this project was to enhance programming skills by working with Python. By utilizing a pre-trained image classifier, the project aimed to identify dog breeds effectively.

# Description
The project involved assisting the organizing committee of a citywide dog show with contestant registration. Participants were required to submit an image of their dog along with biographical information. The registration system assigned tags to the images based on the provided information.

To ensure the accuracy of registrations, a pre-trained Python classifier was utilized to determine if the submitted images indeed depicted dogs. The focus of this project was on implementing Python programming skills rather than developing the classifier itself.

It should be noted that some participants may have attempted to register pets that were not actual dogs. Hence, the image classifier was used to verify the authenticity of the submissions.

# Tasks
The following tasks were performed as part of the project:

- Utilized Python skills to identify the image classification algorithm that performed the best in categorizing images as "dogs" or "not dogs."
- Evaluated the performance of the best classification algorithm in correctly identifying a dog's breed. It was important to consider that image classifiers may not always categorize images correctly.
- Measured the runtime of each algorithm in solving the classification problem. This evaluation helped me understand the trade-off between accuracy and computational resources.
Note: The pre-trained image classifier was provided, and the project focused on applying Python tools to utilize it effectively.
